              <i>The blustery wind obscures my vision, the path forward all but escapes me. However, beyond in the distance, a silver light glistens. Guiding my every step forward, it reunites me back with you.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Gin’iro Haruka is a continuation of the standard of excellence that toneworks provides in their romantic driven stories. It’s a stellar work, and what it offers is honestly quite unique in the realm of visual novels, giving the reader a long and satisfying life journey of these characters, expanding years into their lives. It shakes the phrase “slice of life” to the core of its very foundation as it analyzes both on a micro and macro scale the life journey of the characters as they grow with and because of each other. GinHaru is truly a romantic epic, delivering nothing but heartfelt and genuine romance throughout its entire screen time.</p>
            <p>It shares many things in common with Hoshi Ori. In fact, I would say a good majority of my Hoshi Ori review would apply directly to GinHaru. However, there are some core differences. While compared to Hoshi Ori, GinHaru is not as thematically focused, it makes up for it by making the entire story feel like an odyssey. The protagonist and his respective heroine undergo a complete internal metamorphosis as they come to realize who they are as people and what they mean to themselves and to each other. Each scene is another step forward towards that ultimate goal, as they traverse the sacred road of eternal bliss.</p>
            <p>At its core, GinHaru is a tale of love. The protagonist will fall in love with one of the heroines. Together, they will guide each other step by step. Alone, they are lost, but when they have each other, they can thrive together in harmony. This is exemplified perfectly with the protagonist. Compared to Hoshi Ori, the MC in GinHaru is an aimless wanderer. He has no goals, no aspirations. He’s a textbook definition of a husk. It is only through his love that he is able to find a purpose, a raison d'être. Without that single most important pillar by his side, he would be rotting away, broken down by the emptiness of his meaningless existence. While presenting the protagonist in this manner shows him as a malleable character, following the whims of the story, it does well in exemplifying the main themes in GinHaru.</p>
            <p>The main theme of GinHaru is one of mutual persistence and understanding through love, overcoming trials to reach that happy ending.The first barrier in the protagonist’s way is his own emptiness. He needs to overcome that before he has any chance of having any success obtaining that ultimate goal. Thus, every step after is continuation of that, whether it be in the little moments or the important events. Each scene feels focused in that regard since it loops back to the core overarching theme of the story. No single scene feels wasted, as it serves a purpose in the grander thematic narrative.</p>
            <p>The heroines too are amazing characters in their own right, progressing as people throughout the entire runtime of their respective routes. Each one has their own goals, their own personal struggles. Alongside Yukito, they grow, as their mutual love aids them in pushing unimaginable boundaries. As each route reaches its final climax, both the protagonist and the heroine, and as an extension the reader as well, will look back and see how far they have come as individuals and as a couple. It’s a true catharsis as they reflect on the fruits of their labour and look towards the upcoming seeds they have in store. With the slice of life meant to cultivate this enchanting feeling, each fruit can be traced back to a single seed that was sewed in those scenes all those years ago.</p>
            <p>At its core, GinHaru is the ultimate slow burn. Just like life itself, it may take a while for the seeds to finally sprout, but when they do, it becomes all that more satisfying. Every bit no matter how big or small, is thematically relevant to the GinHaru’s core message as they all work together to deliver an arduous but satisfying journey. Love can conquer any barrier and no matter what distance may separate these lovers, their mutual love will guide them right back to each other.</p>

                      At the end of autumn, I got a younger sister. She is someone who has never seen the ocean. <br>
                      I didn't know what to say, so I took my sister to the beach. <br>
                      And so our daily lives began. <br> <br>

                      The protagonist Aono Shion lives in the countryside where the city is snowy.<br>
                      He will soon leave the school which he used to attend.<br> <br>

                      ―― "Graduation" <br> <br>

                      After graduation, he will move to Tokyo for higher education. <br> <br>

                      The younger sister who will no longer lives with him―Aono Nana, <br>
                      The classmates who will no longer be with him―Sumiki Kotoha, Hagino Yume, and Chigira Shuuto, <br>
                      The underclassman who will no longer with him―Nabatake Inaba, and <br>
                      The homeroom teacher who will no longer with him―Matsuki Ira. <br> <br>

                      Farewells are bound to come, be it to shallow, or to deep relationships. <br> <br>

                      As he prepares to graduate and move to Tokyo, Shion takes his goodbyes to the place
                       he grew up at and everyone he grew up with. While he's at it, he also recalled the
                        bonds he had forged, the feelings he realized for the first time, and the signs he was
                        finally able to notice. He spends his remaining days with the feeling of loneliness on
                        leaving his hometown, mixed with the feeling of excitement of new world he's about to go,
                        eventually, the day comes. <br> <br>

                        This is the story about Shion and his friends about what "graduation" means.</p>
