          </h5>
          <div class="container-fluid review-text">
            <p>I'll start this review off with the obligatory "Read the previous 3 episodes first" disclaimer. This isn't a series you can fully enjoy unless you have all, and I mean ALL, of the context. You can think of the first 3 episodes as just the required context for Episode 4 even, with Episode 4 being the goal and finale. I'll be breaking the review down into sections as some others do and there will be no spoilers. The sections themselves won't be scored as I've decided to let the overall score I gave the episode speak for itself. Also I'm not one of those people who reads VNs for H-Scenes and in fact I prefer to do without them when I can. Thus this review is for the all ages Steam version and those looking for H-scene opinions will not find them here. With that out of the way, let's get to the specifics.</p>
            <p>-Flaws: <br>
              Let's get the potentially bad stuff out of the way first. Wish as we might, nothing is perfect and this is no exception. Most things I considered flaws were actually from more of a technical standpoint rather than something wrong with the contents of the episode itself though. Again, a reminder that I'm on the Steam version. One heads up I will give is that, if it hasn't been patched or something upon you reading this, there are a couple of areas with untranslated lines or areas where the conversation jumps a line ahead while the voice acting is behind. This almost killed a certain section for me but I nobly persevered. Another heads up is that people seem to have mixed feelings about the translation from what I hear. I personally don't mind that type of thing and my reading experience was pleasant but if you're the type that's a stickler for that then you may want to look into it.</p>
            <p>-Art: <br>
              The art for the 9-nine- series was already pretty good even from the first episode. It's a cutesy anime style and honestly? What more can you ask for? One thing you'll notice is that the developers add more sprites and of course more CGs for the characters and events as the episodes go on. By the time you reach Episode 4 the sprites for all the characters will have increased in variety. Needless to say the CGs are also high quality and do not fall behind.</p>
            <p>-Music: <br>
              In a similar case to the evolving art throughout the episodes the soundtrack for the series as a whole also evolves as one reads through. Starting with a fairly decent soundtrack in episode 1, more tracks get added throughout the episodes. This includes both character themes and just general atmosphere tracks. By the time you reach episode 4 you'll have most tracks from the previous episodes plus whatever was added in for 4 specifically. The tracks themselves range from forgettable to impactful depending on your tastes. In my personal opinion the music in Episode 4 did a fantastic job complementing the atmosphere and characters.</p>
            <p>-Characters: <br>
              SPEAKING of the characters, this is one of the areas where Episode 4 and the 9-nine- series as a whole truly shines. One thing that particularly stuck out that came as a pleasant surprise was the development of the protagonist Kakeru Niimi. He truly comes into his own as a character and it was an absolute thrill riding along with him and cheering him on as he just... does his best! The same goes for the main heroine of the episode. She's by far my favorite of the heroines of the series and was a large part of what made this episode, and by extension this series, so memorable. (I won't go into any spoilertastic details for either of course) The major players from the other episodes of course also return to get their screentime and earn their paychecks. All in all, this cast of characters together in this [REDACTED] situation are an absolute joy to follow.</p>
            <p>-Voices: <br>
              I probably could've included this with the music and made a "sound" category or something but I think that the voice acting deserves some special mention. Particularly one thing that impresses me is that for the whole 9-nine- series the main character is fully voice acted. It's something you don't get to see too often and I really feel like it went a long way towards making him distinctly his own character. The other characters don't fall behind either as both the heroines' and surprisingly even the side characters' voice performers did phenominal jobs at their roles.</p>
            <p>-Plot: <br>
              Of course you can't talk about 9-nine- in general and especially not Episode 4 without mentioning the plot. That being said, I won't actually be mentioning much ABOUT the plot in this wholesome spoiler-free review. I will mention that in the tags section under the synopsis on this episode's main VNDB page, even with spoilers hidden, you'll see some things like "Life and Death Drama", "Superpowers", and "Romance" among other things. Expect something along those lines if you don't know what the series is like in general and for some reason came to Episode 4 anyway. As for my opinion on the plot and how Episode 4 impacts it specifically, well, it's enthralling and even downright cathartic. The other episodes build up the setting and events which all lead to this, the climax. Episode 4 beautifully resolves the main plot and wraps basically everything up. Those who looked at that tags section I mentioned earlier and saw "Cliffhanger Ending", worry not. It's not what you think. (Source: Dude trust me)</p>
            <p>-Final Thoughts: <br>
              So if you've read this far and haven't guessed yet I'll come straight out and say I really enjoyed this series and in particular I LOVED this episode. There's another VNDB mini review for this episode that I read where the reviewer states: "the catharsis it offers can only be rivalled by very few works in this medium" and in my opinion, they're right. If you're into action, drama, and romance, then this series is a must read. Thanks for coming to my TED talk! I'll be here all week.</p>

                      At the end of autumn, I got a younger sister. She is someone who has never seen the ocean. <br>
                      I didn't know what to say, so I took my sister to the beach. <br>
                      And so our daily lives began. <br> <br>

                      The protagonist Aono Shion lives in the countryside where the city is snowy.<br>
                      He will soon leave the school which he used to attend.<br> <br>

                      ―― "Graduation" <br> <br>

                      After graduation, he will move to Tokyo for higher education. <br> <br>

                      The younger sister who will no longer lives with him―Aono Nana, <br>
                      The classmates who will no longer be with him―Sumiki Kotoha, Hagino Yume, and Chigira Shuuto, <br>
                      The underclassman who will no longer with him―Nabatake Inaba, and <br>
                      The homeroom teacher who will no longer with him―Matsuki Ira. <br> <br>

                      Farewells are bound to come, be it to shallow, or to deep relationships. <br> <br>

                      As he prepares to graduate and move to Tokyo, Shion takes his goodbyes to the place
                       he grew up at and everyone he grew up with. While he's at it, he also recalled the
                        bonds he had forged, the feelings he realized for the first time, and the signs he was
                        finally able to notice. He spends his remaining days with the feeling of loneliness on
                        leaving his hometown, mixed with the feeling of excitement of new world he's about to go,
                        eventually, the day comes. <br> <br>

                        This is the story about Shion and his friends about what "graduation" means.</p>
